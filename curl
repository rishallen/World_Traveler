3. header
4. URL that we are sending the post to

-d, --data <data>
              (HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in the same way  that
              a  browser  does when a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This
              will cause curl to pass the data to the server using  the  content-type  application/x-www-
              form-urlencoded.
